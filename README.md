```

```
terraform output variable1
```

```
terraform output variabel2
```

## Day007

Today I did work how to create iam users using `aws_iam_users` resource and how to create s3 bucket using `aws_s3_bucket` and how to upload object to s3 bucket using `aws_s3_bucket_object` resource.

you can check terraform file at [Terraform-Day007](Terraform-Day007/)

## Day008

Today I did work following:
1. How to create aws dynamodb table using `aws_dynamodb_table` resource.
2. How to add item to dynamodb table using `aws_dynamodb_table_item` resource.
3. What is Remote State and State Locking
    * Remote State Backend with S3
        * S3 bucket will be used to store terraform.tfstate file.
    * DynamoDB table will be used for state-locking and consistency check
        * make sure that dynamodb table has to be create and primary key is set.

## Day009

Today I did work following:
1. How to use Remote State Backend with S3.
2. How to use AWS DynamoDB table for state locking.
3. Please refer to https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-manage-terraform-state-28f5697e68fa#0054 page for more details managing terraform state file.

## Day010

Today I did work on how to provision:
1. EC2 Instance with using `aws_instance` resource
2. EIP provisioning using `aws_eip` resource
3. SSH key public key registeration to EC2 instance using `aws_key_pair` resource
4. Using provisioner `local-exec` or `remote-exec` to execute/copy local script/remote script
    * local-exec Provisioner
        The local-exec provisioner invokes a local executable after a resource is created. This invokes a process on the machine running Terraform, not on the resource.
