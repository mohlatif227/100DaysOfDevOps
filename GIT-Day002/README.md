# Git Branching


## What is Branching

- Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.

## Branches in a Nutshell

- Git doesn’t store data as a series of change-sets or differences, but instead as a series of snapshots.
- When you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you staged.
- A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits, you’re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, 		the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.

## Branching Workflows

- Master Branch
- Feature/Develop
- Hotfix Branch
